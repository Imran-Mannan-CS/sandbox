explaining things to others
working on something together
when two or more individuals independently work together to achieve a goal
to collaborate means to help one another to figure out and solve problems
helping people with coding is when someone shows someone how to fix their problem plagiarizing is when someone fixes the code by writing the code
to collaborate means help eachother but not just give them the code you need to tell them where can they find it that is good for them
difficult to do in our group and cannot connect the code
helping each other is giving your partner little tips on their code but not the whole thing
helping is when someone collaborates plagiarism is when someone takes another work without permission
to what extent should you help to answer questions support in a long line of code do not do the code for him refer them to coding websites
copying style is a ok thing
copying code or any work is not ok because the key thing is work you have to do it
to help your friend in coding means if he has a problem and he does not know how to fix it so you show him how to fix it and let him fix it or if he does not know how to do something so you show him how to do it but you do not do it for him
working together is like getting a little bit of help from a friend
plagiarism is when you take somebody elses work and claim it as your own
helping is when you make something more clear to someone or letting them see what you have so they have an idea of how something works but they do not copy word for word
to collaborate means to share ideas help each othr fix mistakes
working together to reach the finish
not doing the work for them but working towards itbecause they might be in need of assistance share code
it means to share your ideas with another person and come up with new ideas to share and help other people with
to help someone its like to depend on someone for the whole time
i think that when you help with people and give them a line of code that is not plagiarism but if someone takes more code or you take code that is plagiarism
when someone explains something to you and gives you an example for you to refer but does not give you the entire assignment the helper leaves space for the person being helped to also contribute themselves
collaborating means to share ideas and brainstorm ideas by helping each other by that I help them with a code or helping them with mistakes without showing them our individually codes
to help means that you help because they do not know what they are doing you help stay in the track
collaborating with other students means to help one another not copy ones work
share code partner code is working win together
when you take someones work you do not understand what it does
